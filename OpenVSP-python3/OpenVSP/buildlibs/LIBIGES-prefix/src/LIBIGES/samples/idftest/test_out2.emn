# Note: This file causes a failure in the libIGES
# curve merging routines. The cutouts have walls
# but the surface is not rendered by FreeCAD, which
# indicates a fault. The surface is rendered by
# SolidWorks, which suggests that the problem is
# either in the representation of the Curve on
# Surface boundary or the model-space boundary curve.
#
# Update: the fault is definitely with the model-space
# boundary curve and is due to not having a start angle
# -M_PI < A <= M_PI
