# This file is intended to verify the behavior when handling
# an OTHER_OUTLINE section. When the object is placed on the
# bottom of the board its vertices should not be mirrored;
# in contrast the vertices of a component placed on the bottom
# are mirrored.

# The board outline is a simple square with a small hole in it
