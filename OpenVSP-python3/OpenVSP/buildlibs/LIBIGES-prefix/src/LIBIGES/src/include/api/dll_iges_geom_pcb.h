 * a list of segments. Once the segments form a closed loop no
 * more segments may be added and the internal segments are arranged

/*
 * NOTES:
 *
 * MESSAGES FOR THE USER:
 * + Operations may result in failures due to invalid geometry; this
 *   object must support a queue of messages in order to be able to
 *   pass meaningful messages onto users who are not using the
 *   software within a UNIX shell.
 *
 * OPERATIONS:
 * + AddSegment: adds another segment to the list; the added segment
 *   must have a start point which coincides with the terminal point
 *   of the previous segment.
 *
 * + AddOutline: the outline may be a GEOM_SEGMENT (circle only)
 *   or a GEOM_OUTLINE (generic outline). If the two outlines intersect
 *   then they are merged and the method returns TRUE, otherwise the
 *   method returns FALSE. If there is invalid geometry (the 2 outlines
 *   intersect at a point or at more than 2 points) the method returns
 *   FALSE and sets an appropriate flag. Intersection at more than 2 points
 *   implies either a floating island of material or a surface with a
 *   likely unintended cutout; in either case it is a serious mechanical
 *   design flaw and is prohibited without exceptions by this software.
 *
 * + SubOutline: the given outline (a GEOM_SEGMENT circle or a GEOM_OUTLINE)
 *   is cut out from *this outline if it intersects the edge and the method
 *   returns TRUE, otherwise the method returns FALSE. If there is invalid
 *   geometry (intersects at a point or at more than 2 points) the method
 *   returns FALSE and sets an appropriate flag. Intersection at more than
 *   2 points may imply that the outline will be split into at least 2
 *   separate bodies; this generally means very poor mechanical design so
 *   with this software it is prohibited without exception. It is possible that
 *   the main ouline will not be split into separate bodies but in such
 *   circumstances the user must work around the 2-point restriction by
 *   dividing the offending cutout into at least 2 separate bodies.
